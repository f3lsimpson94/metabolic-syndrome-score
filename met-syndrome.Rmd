Steps to calculate the MetSSS:

1) Censor: set all biomarker values for each individual case that are below the clinical threshold to the clinical threshold

2) Center: subtract relevant clinical threshold from each biomarker value (optional: winsorize to remove any outliers)

3) Standardize: divide each censored and centered biomarker value by the matching standard deviation shown in Table A.1

4) Orthogonalize: post-multiply the normalized data matrix by the component loading matrix shown in Table A.2

5) Standardize: post-multiply by a diagonal matrix comprised of the inverse of the standard deviations of the principal components shown in Table A.3

6) Square: square each individual value

7) Sum: take the sum of the squared values for each individual row

8) Square root: take the square root of the sum of the squared values
